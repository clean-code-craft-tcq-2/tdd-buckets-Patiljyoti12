# Test Driven Ranges

The charging current varies during the process of charging.
We need to capture the range of current measurements -
what range of currents are most often encountered while charging.

> **DO NOT** jump into implementation! Read the example and the starting task below.


## Example

### Input

Consider a set of periodic current samples from a charging session to be:
`3, 3, 5, 4, 10, 11, 12`

### Functionality

The continuous ranges in there are: `3,4,5` and `10,11,12`.

The task is to detect the ranges and
output the number of readings in each range.

In this example,

- the `3-5` range has `4` readings
- the `10-12` range has `3` readings.

### Output

The expected output would be in comma-separated (csv format):

```
Range, Readings
3-5, 4
10-12, 3
```

## Tasks

Establish quality parameters: 

- What is the maximum complexity (CCN) per function? 3
- How many lines of duplicate code will you tolerate? 3
- Ensure 100% line and branch coverage at every step. Include the coverage yml in the workflows.

Adapt/adopt/extend the `yml` files from one of your previous workflow folders.

Start Test-driven approach

1. Write the smallest possible failing test: give input `4,5`. assert output to be `4-5, 2`.
1. Write the minimum amount of code that'll make it pass.
1. Refactor any assumptions, continue to pass this test. Do not add any code without a corresponding test.

1.rearrange_samples(input_samples)
This method takes charging current samples from one session as input and returns the sorted sequence of samples
Input:
It can be a list with 'n' of elements
Valid Inputs: a) each element in list should be > 0 b) elememts in an list can be consecutive or non-consecutive
Invalid Inputs: a) Empty array b) Negative elements

2.get_ranges_from_samples(input_samples)
This method takes sorted sequence of samples as input and returns all possible ranges from sorted sequence of samples 

3.get_no_of_readings_in_range(samples_ranges)
This method takes range as input and list the total no of occurances of elements in given range 

4. display_samples_details_onconsole(samples_ranges)
This method takes range as input and counts the no of elements within the range and displays the result in csv format

This method takes input samples as input  and then identifies only valid samples within 4094 in the given input sample list and returns converted to Amp value for the
valid samples as output
